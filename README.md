# CodSoft Python Internship Projects

This repository contains the tasks I completed as part of the **CodSoft Python Programming Internship (March–April 2025)**.  
Each project is built from scratch using Python and demonstrates my ability to solve real-world problems with clean code and CLI-based interaction.


✅ Completed Tasks

🔹 Task 1: To-Do List
A command-line to-do list application where users can add, delete, and view tasks.

📁 Folder: ToDo List

🔹 Task 3: Password Generator
A CLI app to generate strong, customizable passwords based on user preferences like length, letters, numbers, and special characters.

📁 Folder:"Password generator"

🔹 Task 5: Contact Book
A contact management app with features like add, view, search, update, and delete contacts. Built entirely for CLI with clean, user-friendly prompts.

📁 Folder: "Contact book"


🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Git & GitHub
- Command Line (CLI) Applications

📌 Note

Only 3 tasks were required to complete the internship. I chose tasks that challenged me and helped me build my understanding of Python fundamentals and real-world problem-solving.
